### What went well

### What could have gone better

We originally setup the project with the Expo CLI and decided to switch to the React Native CLI.
<!-- Include reasons why here -->
Expo setup resources:
- [React Native with Expo](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started)
- [Android Studio Emulator](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
To make the switch we had to complete a [hard uninstall](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17625622/how-to-completely-uninstall-android-studio-on-mac) of Android Studio and then follow the [setup resources above](#learning-resources).
